  criteria: vitamin C absorption and transportation
  general_information: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a water-soluble vitamin that is
    required for biosynthesis of collagen which makes it vital to our body for healing
    process. Vitamin C also acts as antioxidant because it protects our cells against
    harmful effects of free radicals. Deficiency of vitamin C can lead to anemia,
    easy bruising, spontaneous bleeding, and sometimes, ulceration of the gums and
    loss of teeth. Vitamin C is naturally present in some fruits and vegetables, such
    as citrus, red and green peppers, tomatoes, broccoli, and leafy greens.
  genes:
    SLC23A1: SLC23A1 is a gene which encodes for a key protein for the transport and
      accumulation of vitamin C. The protein is also involved in dietary absorption
      and renal reabsorption of vitamin C. The presence of rare allele (T) of rs33972313
      variant in the SLC23A1 gene is related to lower concentrations of circulating
      vitamin C.
  group: Nutrient Metabolism
  interpretation_choice:
    average: Based on your genetic profile, you are at average risk to have a lower
      vitamin C levels in your blood.
    low: Based on your genetic profile, you are at increased risk to have a lower
      vitamin C levels in your blood.

  recommendation_choice:
    average: Meet the RDA for vitamin C of 90 mg for adult men and 75 mg for adult
      women. Dietary sources of vitamin C are kiwi, papaya, strawberries, cooked broccoli,
      and red or green pepper. Daily intake of these fruits and vegetables are recommended
      as much as 5 servings.
    low: Ensure that vitamin C intake is at least 200 mg (or higher but less than
      1 g) per day in order to reduce the risk of deficiency. Foods that are naturally
      high in vitamin C include kiwi, papaya, strawberries, cooked broccoli, and red
      or green pepper. You can check your vitamin C status in blood to determine the
      sufficiency of this nutrient in your body.
