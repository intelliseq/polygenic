It is made up of low-density lipoprotein (LDL or \"bad\" cholesterol) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL or \"good\" cholesterol). Diet is a source of cholesterol, but the body also makes it. A low HDL cholesterol level can cause a risk for heart disease and other health issues, especially if your triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and/or inflammatory biomarker levels are high.  A positive goal is to raise HDL. Several factors contribute to overall cholesterol levels, including lifestyle, and genetics.', 'how_your_result_was_calculated': 'Your result is a risk based on 312 genetic variants, specifically called SNPs, found in 250 genes associated with blood HDL level.
